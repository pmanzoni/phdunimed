# Hands-on Dockers for networking
> Offerta formativa A.A. 2020-2021, Corso di Dottorato in Ingegneria dellâ€™Informazione

This course will focus on the use of containers for the modelling and evaluation of applications, with a strong focus on networking. A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and

settings. As a case study of a networking application, the course will present OpenThread. OpenThread, released by Google, is an open-source implementation of the Thread networking protocol. Google Nest has released OpenThread to make the technology used in Nest products broadly available to developers to accelerate the development of products for the connected home. The Thread specification defines an IPv6-based reliable, secure and low-power wireless device-to-device communication protocol for home applications. OpenThread implements all Thread networking layers including IPv6, 6LoWPAN, IEEE 802.15.4 with MAC security, Mesh Link Establishment, and Mesh Routing.
The course is organized as a succession of theoretical and experimental (hands-on) parts.
