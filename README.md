# Hands-on Dockers for networking
> Offerta formativa A.A. 2020-2021, Corso di Dottorato in Ingegneria dellâ€™Informazione

This course will focus on the use of Docker containers for the modelling and evaluation of applications, with a strong focus on networking. A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. 

Various cases studies will be presented, the main one being OpenThread. OpenThread, released by Google, is an open-source implementation of the Thread networking protocol. 

The course is organized as a succession of theoretical and experimental (hands-on) parts.
